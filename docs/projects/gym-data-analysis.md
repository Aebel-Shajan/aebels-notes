# Gym Data Analysis

I want to gain more insight on my gym stats which I record using the Strong app. The strong app already provides some good graph visualisation, but its very simple and very specific. Also I figured this would be a good project to practice my data analysis skills with python. I might extend this project to also include my fitbit data. 

I thought about doing this project in pyspark and sql. However, I figured I would be less likely to abandon, it if I just stuck to what I knew. So pandas, numpy, and seaborn it is.

## Data gathering

The strong app does not have an api like fitbit does where I can regularly collect my information. Instead there is an option to manually extract your data in a csv format. 


## Data visualisation

Theres a lot of information you can extract from this csv file. Here's a couple things I want to obtain:

* Do like one of those github yearly calander frequency charts.

* Have a graph of how weekly gym frequency changes.

* Obtain like the average weight I lift per set of 7/8 reps
